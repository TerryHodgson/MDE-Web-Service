This is a web application that integrates MathJax with MDE to render asciimath equations in MathML. This is done on the client side through MathJax. The server is running on Apache Tomcat 7.0 and has a basic gui interface that allows the user to add math equations and get descriptions and the equation rendered in MathML (this is in WebContent/index.html). MathEquation.jsp handles the dynamic content in index.html, notably the combobox that allows the user to select the equations the user wants to see.
